__A (WIP) Resourcepack for Slimefun based on RaulH22's and HauntedCorpse's textures.__

:warning: This resourcepack is designed for Chime; a Fabric only CIT alternative to Optifine.

# :rainbow: Features 
- Works without the need of item-models.yml
- Support for dark GUI for [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/) users
- Works with Slimefun's new translation feature

# :hammer_and_wrench: Usage 

:warning: This resourcepack currently requires the use of [Chime](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/chime); an alternative to Optifine CIT avaliable only to Fabric users.
- Chime is available only for 1.16 & 1.17 (from [source](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/chime/tree/1.17))
